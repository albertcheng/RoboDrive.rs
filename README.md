# RoboDrive.rs
RoboDrive.rs is an open-source framework for building self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, and smart systems, written in Rust. 

RoboDrive.rs is an open-source framework for building self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, and smart systems, written in Rust. It offers a modular, high-performance, and safe environment for robotics development, focusing on real-time control, sensor integration, and path planning.

Whether you‚Äôre working on a self-driving car, robotic lawn mower, delivery drone, or indoor navigation robot, RoboDrive.rs provides the essential building blocks to accelerate your project.

‚ú® Features
Core Message Bus for inter-module communication

Sensor Fusion for LiDAR, GPS, IMU, and Camera data

Path Planning and Localization (A*, SLAM, and more)

Real-time Control with hardware abstraction and PID controllers

Computer Vision and Object Detection using OpenCV and deep learning integration

Simulation Support for testing in virtual environments (Gazebo, Unity)

High Safety and Performance powered by Rust‚Äôs memory safety and concurrency

üìö Why Rust?
Memory Safety: No more worrying about null pointers or data races.

High Performance: Comparable to C/C++ with fearless concurrency.

Reliability: Build robotics systems that won‚Äôt crash in critical situations.

üèó Architecture Overview
RoboDrive.rs is built on a modular design, with each component as a separate crate:

robotics_core: Core services like message passing, logging, and configuration.

robotics_sensor: Drivers for sensors (LiDAR, GPS, IMU, Camera) with sensor fusion.

robotics_navigation: Path planning, localization, and SLAM support.

robotics_control: Motor control, PID controllers, and hardware abstraction.

robotics_perception: Computer vision and deep learning inference for object detection.

robotics_simulation: Virtual environment integration for fast testing and iteration.
